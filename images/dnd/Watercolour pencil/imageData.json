    "description": "Belladonna (or Bella for short) is a Firbolg fighter from a couple of one shot games. I didn't give her a deep backstory as she wasn't in an actual campaign but I think I captured enough of it in the picture. This was the first colour pencil picture where I tried to avoid over-layering like I did on previous ones. It made me really think about which colours to show and I really liked the result. I wanted to keep the pen outline but reduced the amount in the background to keep the focus on Bella.",

    "description": "My first coloured pencil piece and it's one of my favourites. Gleeb is a street urchin and I wanted to capture her edgy look and mischievous personality in a dank victorian London-esq back alley of Eng-Teilen. I also love the colours and having to use purples to show the different levels of shade in such a dimly lit scene.",

    "description": "Despite over-layering the colour on this one, I like how bold it made the colours. It was a little challenging to get the depth of shadow right and as well as deciding how to display objects in the room. I also got through a ton of colouring pencil, in hindsight it may have been better suited to paint.",

    "description": "This was one of those pictures I drew the outline for ages ago and never knew how to go about colouring it in. After my recent stint with coloured pencils was going well I thought I'd give it a go. Despite a couple of (in my opinon) glaring mistakes I'm pretty happy with the idea behind the picture. I wanted to capture both sides of the life of one of the most prominent, loved and hated NPCs of our game, the ranger Flisk. His simple life of troll bounty hunter, and that of after he met our group and had a curse placed upoon him, living as a rebel leader in the dank streets of Eng-Teilen.",
