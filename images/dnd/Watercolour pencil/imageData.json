    "description": "Belladonna (or Bella for short) is a Firbolg fighter from a couple of one shot games. I didn't give her a deep backstory as she wasn't in an actual campaign but I think I captured enough of it in the picture. This was the first colour pencil picture where I tried to avoid over-layering like I did on previous ones. It made me really think about which colours to show and I really liked the result. I wanted to keep the pen outline but reduced the amount in the background to keep the focus on Bella.",

    "description": "My first watercolour pencil piece and it's one of my favourites. Gleeb is a street urchin and I wanted to capture her edgy look and mischievous personality in a dank victorian London-esq back alley of Eng-Teilen. I also love the colours and having to use purples to show the different levels of shade in such a dimly lit scene.",

    "description": "Despite over-layering the colour on this one, I like how bold it made the colours. It was a little challenging to get the depth of shadow right and as well as deciding how to display objects in the room. I also got through a ton of colouring pencil, in hindsight it may have been better suited to paint.",
