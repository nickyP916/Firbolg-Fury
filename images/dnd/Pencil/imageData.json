    "description": "This is a very old piece that I never got around to finishing. I made the mistake of drawing it on sketch paper, so using watercolours wouldn't work and coloured pencils are also likely to ruin it. I may try to copy this onto another medium, possibly digital. It was a fun scene where the group convinced our companion Flisk to take part in a drinking game against a goliath. I'm happy that I took the time to add detail to the decor of the tavern in the background and look forward to adding colour to it.",

    "description": "Another old one, this was a showcase of the rediculousness of our barbarian, Bearpaw. Despite having a difficult fight up ahead of us, he decided to expend his last rage on a group of bats that angered him. I loved figuring out how to show light and shadow in the cave, particularly against the membrane quality of the bats' wings.",

    "description": "A poster style piece to commemorate Dramp the goblin joining our quest after the death of Bearpaw. I realised drawing goblins is very fun, being unbound by regular human facial dimensions you can really have some fun with exaggerating things like the nose to add character.",

    "description": "I felt a lot more confident with pencil drawings by the time I drew this one. Trying to capture the moment glass shattered and how that would look as the arrow from Dramp's crossbow flies through it was pretty challenging. I also realised that despite being happy to put the effort into the characters, my patience with pencil started to wane a bit when it came to shading background, hence it looking a little unfinished. Maybe I'll need to revisit this one.",
