        "description": "This was my first go with watercolours. I didn't really know what I was doing and didn't bother with any tutorials, so it was more of an experiment. However despite its roughness I'm quite happy with it, and had a lot of fun experimenting with the colours. I went for a movie style poster again, trying to sum up an entire evening's session in one image.",

        "description": "I think I did this one not too long after the Prince of Thieves one, so I was still very much a beginner with watercolours. I wanted to capture the moment two of the party woke a stone giant when they walked into a fight. The colours are a bit bright and vibrant for my liking now, but I do like the looming giant in the background.",
